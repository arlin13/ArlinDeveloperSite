            <p>I love to travel. It always amazes me how different life is in different places of the world.</p>
            <p>I really love knowing new places and new people, I enjoy speaking with</p>
            <p>the locals to know their perspective of the world</p>
            <br><p>Another thing that I love of travelling is that it challenges you in different ways.</p>
            <br><p>From moving in a city / country / continent that you don't know,</p>
            <p>to try food for the first time, speak in a foreign language</p>
            <p>or even be in a place where you don't know their language,</p>
            <p>so you have to communicate with signs and gestures!</p>

            <p>I play basketball since I was 10 years old.</p>
            <p>I was part of the state team and went to 7 national olympics in Mexico</p>
            <p>I went to 4 College National Tournaments</p>
            <p>And was once selected in the top 5 players of Mexico</p>
            <p>Thanks to basketball I was able to study in top high-school and college from Mexico</p>
            <p>Anyway, those are the memories of the good old days.<p/>
            <p>Now I keep playing but just as a hobbie, mostly on the weekends with my friends</p>

            <p>When I was in elementary school I read the Harry Potter books</p>
            <p>And is thank to them that I discovered my passion to read</p>
            <p>Nothing compares to a good book that can help you to discover new worlds,</p>
            <p>learn new things, improve your vocabulary and writing skills,</p>
            <p>or just to disconnect yourself for a while and relax</p>
            <br><p>Another of my passions is to draw</p>
            <p>I have to confess...</p>
            <p>I don't draw os often as I used to, but is something that I still enjoy doing</p>
            <p>This drawing is from 2001 aprox.</p>
